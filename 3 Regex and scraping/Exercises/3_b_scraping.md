You can solve this by emulating a click on the next page using the webdriver. Then repeat the scraping process until you've had them all.

Export the list in a CSV-file

## Staalhard 100

Belgium has a lot of radio stations, and Willy, another one, also has a [list of the best heavy metal records](https://www.willy.radio/hitlijsten/staalhard-100-bekijk-de-lijst). Scrape it and export this list in another CSV-file. Compare the two: which songs are on the heaviest list but not on the steel-hard 100 and visa versa? Which are on both?
